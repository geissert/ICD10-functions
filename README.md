# ICD10-functions
Tools written for R to identify and pull ICD10 codes from text documents, manipulate and query icd10data website to scrape description information, and output ready for use as a SAS macro or format.

I wrote these some time ago for a specific project, but have hoped to generalize them to handle icd9 codes as well, and possibly translations between the two (though this is a trickier business as the two classification systems do not map to one another 1:1).
